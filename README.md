# Flintux OS

**Flintux OS is a linux distribution based on the monolithic kernel that aims to be very light on resources and minimal.**
Flintux OS is built with buildroot. This means it can be configured using the 'make menuconfig' command in the source code directory, then it can be built into a .img file to be used in an external drive.
